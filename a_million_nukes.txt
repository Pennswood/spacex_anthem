I close my eyes and I can see
A Mars that's waiting up for me
That we call our own
Through the sky, through the stars
Through where no one's flown before
But it's time to launch
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds
I don't care, I don't care, so call us crazy
We can live in a Mars that we design
'Cause every night I lie in place
The brightest colors fill my space
A million nukes are keeping me awake
I think of what our Mars could be
A vision of the one we see
A million nukes is all it's gonna take
Oh a million nukes for the Mars we terraform
<skip>
There's a ship we can build
Every tank inside is filled
With cryogenic gas
Special plans we deploy
Each line there to make you fly
Through a perfect launch
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds
I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy
Runaway to a Mars that we design
Every night I lie in place
The brightest colors fill my space
A million nukes are keeping me awake
I think of what our Mars could be
A vision of the one we see
A million nukes is all it's gonna take
Oh a million nukes for the Mars we terraform
<end-skip>
However good, however bad
Let me be part of it all
Share your flights with me
It may go up, it may blow up
But say that you'll fly me along
To the Mars we see
To the Mars I close my eyes to see
I close my eyes to see
Every night I lie in place
The brightest colors fill my space
A million nukes are keeping me awake
A million nukes, a million nukes
I think of what our Mars could be
A vision of the one I see
A million nukes is all it's gonna take
A million nukes for the Mars we terraform
For the Mars we terraform
